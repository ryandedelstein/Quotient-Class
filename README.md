# Quotient-Class
C++ review for interviews, implementation of full quotient class with equivalent functionality to double, int. Variable size incremenation.
Work In Progress. Will support multiple iterators, prime factorization, epsilon comparison with doubles.

10/16 Commit: Initial commit of quotient class. All operators defined implemented. Supports binary operations between two Rats, as well as a Rat and a double, std::pair<int, int>, and std::pair<double, double>. Friend/free functions for backwards associativity.
